This is a polyglot monorepo containing reusable packages, apps and patterns.

## 🚀 Included

- 🐉 Lerna — The Monorepo manager
- 📦 Yarn Workspaces — Sane multi-package management
- 🐠 Babel — Compiles next-gen JavaScript
- 🛠 Rollup — Next-generation ES module bundler

## 🚄 Monorepo

[Lerna](https://lerna.js.org) and [Yarn Workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) give us the ability to build libraries and apps in a single repo (a.k.a. Monorepo) without forcing us to publish to NPM until we are ready. This makes it faster to iterate locally when building components that depend on each other.

Lerna also provides high-level commands to optimize the management of multiple packages. For example, with one Lerna command, you can iterate through all the packages, running a series of operations (such as linting, testing, and building) on each package.

## 📦 Packages

In order to improve our development practices and standards we released various packages. If you find any of the packages useful you can easily import them via Node Package Manager (npm).

## 📚 Patterns

We provide a list of patterns including examples. There is a clear separation of concerns to make multiple patterns usable altogether.

- ⚛️ React — JavaScript library for user interfaces
- 💅 styled-components — CSS in JS elegance
- 📖 Storybook — UI Component Environment
- 🃏 Jest — Unit/Snapshot Testing

### Development scripts

Useful scripts include:

#### `yarn install`

> Installs package dependencies and links packages together - using lerna

#### `yarn lint`

> boolean check if code conforms to linting rules - uses remark & eslint

- `yarn lint:js` - will check js
- `yarn lint:js --fix` - will automatically fix js

#### `yarn release`

> Push a release to git and npm will ask for version in interactive mode - using lerna.
