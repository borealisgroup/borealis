# borealis-js

A collection of JavaScript patterns and packages that we reuse across projects.

## Packages

> There is no straight answer for React. You need to collect blocks by yourself. There are many ways you can build an app, but itâ€™s you who needs to decide what to use.

Why React chose to be a library instead of a framework? It goes with its own philosophy of how to build apps. In one word: **flexibility**. The Javascript ecosystem is rapidly evolving and we want to be part of this journey by experimenting the latest trends.

In order to improve our development practices and standards we released various packages. If you find any of the packages usefull you can easily import them via Node Package Manager (npm).

## Patterns

We provide a list of patterns including examples. Following React's philosophy, there is a clear separation of concerns to make multiple patterns usable altogether.

## Monorepo

We're using [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) to share everything in a monorepo.

**Pros:**

- Single lint, build, test and release process.
- Easy to coordinate changes across modules.
- Single place to report issues.
- Easier to setup a development environment.
- Tests across modules are run together which finds bugs that touch multiple modules easier.
- Sharing modules easily.

**Cons:**

- Codebase looks more intimidating.
- Repo is bigger in size.
