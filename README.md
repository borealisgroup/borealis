## Motivation

### Monorepo

**Pros:**

- Single lint, build, test and release process.
- Easy to coordinate changes across modules.
- Single place to report issues.
- Easier to setup a development environment.
- Tests across modules are run together which finds bugs that touch multiple modules easier.

**Cons:**

- Codebase looks more intimidating.
- Repo is bigger in size.

### Shared coding style

[Why do we need a shared coding style accross the company?](https://medium.com/@natterstefan/how-to-create-your-own-shared-eslint-prettier-and-stylelint-configuration-3930dd764de3)

TL;DR - For **consistency**, **productivity** and **happiness**.
