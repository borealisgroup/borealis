# borealis-js

A collection of patterns, libraries and boilerplates in Borealis Digital Studio.

## Libraries

> There is no straight answer for React. You need to collect blocks by yourself. There are many ways you can build an app, but itâ€™s you who needs to decide what to use.

Why React chose to be a library instead of a framework? It goes with its own philosophy of how to build apps. In one word: **flexibility**.

The Javascript ecosystem is rapidly evolving and we want to be part of this journey by experimenting the latest trends.

## Patterns

We provide a list of patterns including examples. Following React's philosophy, there is a clear separation of concerns to make multiple patterns usable altogether. 

## Boilerplates

In fact, the all-in-one perfect boilerplate doesn't exist. 

However, we consider our boilerplates as proposals of starting-point template for a new project. Each boilerplate links together some of our libraries and patterns.

## Monorepo

We're using [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) to share everything in a monorepo.

**Pros:**

- Single lint, build, test and release process.
- Easy to coordinate changes across modules.
- Single place to report issues.
- Easier to setup a development environment.
- Tests across modules are run together which finds bugs that touch multiple modules easier.
- Sharing modules easily.

**Cons:**

- Codebase looks more intimidating.
- Repo is bigger in size.
