In fact, the all-in-one perfect boilerplate doesn't exist. 

However, we consider this boilerplate as a starting-point template for a new React project. Each boilerplate links together some of our libraries and patterns.

## Patterns

- atomic-design
- ducks-pattern
- config-pattern

## Packages

- @borealisgroup/eslint-config
- @borealisgroup/stylelint-config
- @borealisgroup/stylelint-config
- @borealisgroup/theme

## Example branch

This boilerplate is not applying all the packages and patterns since that would create a situation where you have to remove code to get started. In order to demo all the packages and patterns we created an [example branch](https://github.com/borealisgroup/react-boilerplate/tree/example) based on this boilerplate.
