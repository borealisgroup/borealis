Complete Atomic Design example for a React app.

## Prerequisites

- react

## Usage

<!-- TODO - example -->
See the [example](example)

## Why

Large applications can quickly become very painful to maintain. Therefore it is useful to apply the popular atomic design to your React app.

### Overview

### Project Structure

This is a classical atomic design application:
- `/atoms` -  composed of a single HTML tag or third-party component. Should be reused at least once, to avoid redundancy.

- `/molecules` - composed of atoms

- `/organisms` - composed of organisms/molecules/atoms (the most common case)

- `/templates` - layout of pages (with styling) - composed of organisms

- `/pages` - provided to a Route, without any styling - pages are just instances of templates by passing down the needed organisms (Header, Footer, etc.) as props

Now, let's go further by using a hybrid approach: structuring `/molecules` and `/organisms` by **routes**, as they can be large very quick.

- `/organisms/common` - typically for components used by multiple routes, where the reusability pattern is applied
- `/organisms/<route>` - the components used only in this route

Basically, more there is components inside `/common`, more there is reused components, proving that using React in your app was a good choice.

Therefore, the end goal is to add as much components as possible in `/commonâ€Œ` by extracting duplicate code among all the components. 

Note that `/atoms` is not structured by route as atoms **should** be reused at least once. 

If one folder (i.e. `/common`) gets large, you can one more time **structure by feature** (i.e. `/common/modals`).

This pattern works very good with [dynamic-export](https://github.com/borealisgroup/borealis-js/tree/master/packages/dynamic-export), as you can move the files as many times as you want without any modification in the code.
